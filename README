# Graphing lm-sensors data with D3
Point here is to try re-creating the graph from scratch
With the end goal to be a large re-design potentially having data come in at real time, to be graphed, and simultaneously or after - inserted to the DB.
I need a Node JS server running on my machine or in a docker container
How this will work: server saves json output, parses to dict or whatever it calls it. 
Then save it in a sensible way - perhaps in a dict of timestamp...?
But I think I rather have a dict for each sensor????
